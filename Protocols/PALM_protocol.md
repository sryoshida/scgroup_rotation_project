# Photoactivatable localization microscopy protocol
### A quick note
This is still very much a work of progress. These are the parameters that worked best with the ever-changing demo unit -- not necessarily what will work 
best at the BIF. For a detailed description of PALM, [this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1127344) can be referenced, or for a more broad 
overview of how PALM is related to the broader field of super-resolution imaging, [this presentation](../Presentations/20211025_group_meeting.pptx) may be useful.

### Imaging with PALM
At this point, we should have a fixed sample, labelled with photoactivatable dyes. If not, refer to [this staining protocol](/Protocols/staining_protocol.pdf) to learn how to stain your sample, or if you have already stained it, reference [this fixation protocol](../Protocols/fixation_protocol.md) to learn how to fix your cell and label with Hoechst DNA dye if necessary.

#### Acquisition sequence
While it was suggested by Meagan Esbin of the Tjian + Darzacq Group at UC Berkeley that we have the activation laser (405 nm) and aquisition laser(561/647 nm depending on the PA-dye used) turned on simulataneously with the following acquisition sequence.

| Exposure sequence | Camera aquisition | Camera aquisition | Camera aquisition | Camera aquisition | Camera aquisition | ...
|| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ...
| Activation beam | 405 nm  | 405 nm  | 405 nm  | 405 nm  | 405 nm  | ...
| Aquisition beam | 561/647 nm | 561/647 nm  | 561/647 nm  | 561/647 nm  | 561/647 nm  | ...
|| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ...
| Integration time | 100 ms | 100 ms | 100 ms | 100 ms | 100 ms | ...
