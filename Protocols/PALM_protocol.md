# Photoactivatable localization microscopy protocol
### A quick note
This is still very much a work of progress. These are the parameters that worked best with the ever-changing demo unit -- not necessarily what will work 
best at the BIF. For a detailed description of PALM, [this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1127344) can be referenced, or for a more broad 
overview of how PALM is related to the broader field of super-resolution imaging, [this presentation](scgroup_rotation_project/Presentations/20211025_group_meeting.pptx) may be useful.
