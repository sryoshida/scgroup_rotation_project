# Fixation protocol
At this point, we should have a sample labelled with photoactivatable dyes. If not, refer to [this staining protocol](/Protocols/staining_protocol.pdf) to learn how to stain your sample with a PA dye. Be sure to keep your sample covered with aluminum foil for as much of this process as possible to prevent premature photobleaching/photodamage. 

To stain the nucleus more broadly, the Hoechst DNA dye is used. Prepare an appropriate volume (500 Î¼L for a MatTek imaging dish) of a 1:2000 (v/v) dilution of Hoechst dye in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). I would not recommend trying to do super-resolution imaging with the Hoechst dye also present as it introduces a lot of background fluorescence as it is excited by the 405 nm (the same laser used for photoactivation of the PA dyes). 

1. Aspirate growth media, then rinse sample twice with PBS.
2. Fix the cells with an appropriate amount of 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA) for 15 minutes (for a MatTek imaging dish, use 500 &mu; L). Keep agitating the plate via shaker/rocker the entire time.
3. Rinse twice with PBS, then agitate for 5 minutes in PBS (again, using a shaker/rocker). If the Hoechst dye is unnecessary, repeat this step three times, then rinse in PBS one last time. Otherwise continue to step 4.
4. Rinse twice with PBS again, then introduce the 1:2000 Hoechst dye dilution and agitate for 5 minutes.
5. Rinse twice with PBS again, then agitate for 5 minutes in PBS. Rinse the final product with PBS one more time.


When finished, make sure to keep cells submerged in PBS and the imaging dish covered in alumninum foil. The sample should be stored at 4&deg;C until imaging. Can hypothetically be stored for longer periods of time (i.e. days to weeks), but this may result in many of the dyes detaching, and will lower the overall quality of your super-resolution image.
