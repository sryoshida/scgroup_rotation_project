# Data storage locations/descriptions
Microscopy data is too large to be kept on GitHub, and is instead stored on an external hard disk drive. Data taken at the BIF was saved as
</br>
`/BIF/date/fluorophore/cell#`
</br></br>
The data taken on the demo unit is useless as far as drawing conclusions, but is included here anyways. It is organized between old and new workbench directories, and labelled by fluorophore name and day # (this is a bad naming convention, don't do this in the future).
</br>
`e.g. /old workbench/HaloTag_PA-JF549_Day_2/`
</br></br>

The drift tests for both the demo unit and the BIF's unit are included in the XY stage drift directory.
