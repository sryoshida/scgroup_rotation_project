# Sub-diffraction limit characterization of size and concentration of EWS-FLI1 LCD-mediated transcription hubs 
Multivalent interactions between the intrinsically disordered regions of transcription factors like EWS-FLI1 (and other transcriptional regulators like RNA Pol II and transcriptional cofactors) form “hubs” --  local, high-concentration regions about the gene loci. We apply super-resolution techniques to present distributions that quantify both size of these hubs, and the absolute protein number within these hubs.

This repository contains work done by SY over the course of the Fall rotation in Dr. Shasha Chong's group at Caltech, including 
- Jupyter notebooks containing exploratory models and super-resolution analysis 
- Presentations given at group meetings, journal clubs, and the BMB rotation seminar
- Protocols developed for staining cells and imaging with photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM)
- Reference sheets for cell line/reagents in use and data taken
